# Driver_Duck

Driver_Duck is a python program designed to work with both input/output of multiple drivers. It is currently a work in progress and still in beta stages. Although in Beta, Driver_Duck is still usable and already is capable of capturing certain I/O, such as from /dev/input/mouse0 on Linux systems.

Driver Duck is only useful for Linux Systems at the moment, but long term project goals include expanding Driver Duck to work with all OS's, and with different hardware.
