# Driver_Duck

Driver_Duck is a python program designed to work with both input/output of multiple drivers. It is currently a work in progress and still in beta stages. 

Although in Beta, Driver_Duck is still usable and already is capable of capturing certain I/O, such as from /dev/input/mouse0 on Linux systems.

Driver Duck is only useful for Linux Systems at the moment, but long term project goals include expanding Driver Duck to work with all Operating Systems, and with different hardware.

Driver Duck can act as two things, 1) a program ran by a user  2) a module imported by a programmer.
Driver Duck is made this way to support both GNU coders and people who can not code but need to use the software.

If you have I/O code that you wish to add to driver duck, you can request it at the email provided. All code added with give you credit, and cite you as the author.

As a product of the GNU and FOSS community, please feel free to send your suggestions for driver_duck at denkweise9@gmail.com.
I am always open to constructive criticism and improvements.
