# Driver_Duck



Driver_Duck is a python program designed to work with both input/outputs of multiple drivers. It is currently a work in progress.
Driver Duck is only useful for Linux Systems at the moment, but long term project goals include expanding Driver Duck to work with all OS's, and with different hardware.
